# TinyModel

TinyModel is a PHP superclass that lets you very easily define the Model layer of your web application, and handles the communication between application code and database, returning user-friendly nested objects.

## Defining tables

To configure TinyModel, you create a set of subclasses, each representing a table in your database schema. The columns of the table are defined using class constants, specifying the name and type of the column, and optional restrictions that apply to what may be inserted into it.

### Class & table names

With TinyModel, the name of the table is always the (lowercase) plural of the name of the class. To define a table `users`, you just create a class called User.

### Column specification

To define a column in your table, you create a class constant with the same name as the column, and initialize it with a *column specification string*, with the format `"type [restrictions]"`:

- type: one of the following: `int`, `float`, `varchar`, `text`, `timestamp`
- restrictions: one or more of: `alphabetical`, `alphanumeric`, `email`, `url`, `positive`, `notnull`, `maxlength=N`

### Example of a class

If you have tables `users` and `items`, you might create two classes as follows:

    class User extends TinyModel {
    	const userid = 'int  notnull';
    	const username = 'varchar alphanumeric maxlength=20';
    	const email = 'varchar email';
    }
    
    class Items extends TinyModel {
    	const itemid = 'int notnull';
    	const userid = 'int notnull';
    	const itemname = 'varchar maxlength=20';
    }

Interacting with these tables is then very straightforward, using the methods detailed below.


## Methods

### fetch

`fetch($conditions, $joins)`

Static method. Attempt to fetch items from the database. Return values:

- an array representing the returned object(s) on success
- false on database error

Parameters:

- *conditions*

A Condition object, or an array of Condition objects, specifying what should be returned by the query. For instance, to only return rows where the userid is 76:

    new Condition('userid', 76)

You can specify multiple nested conditions, and the relationships between them (`and` or `or`), by passing a nested array. For details, see below under Conditions. At least one valid Condition object is required.

Static method. Returns one ore more objects matching the given condition(s). Any successful joins will be represented as sub-objects of their parents.

- *joins*

An optional Join object, or an array of Join objects, specifying joins to perform from results in this table to further tables.

*e.g.* Fetch user(s) with id 76, joined to any favourites, joined to those favourites themselves:

    User::fetch(
        new Condition('userid', 76),
        new Join('Favourite', 'userid', new Join('Thing', 'thingid')))
    );


### update

`update($updates, $conditions)`

Static method. Updates objects matching the given condition(s). Return values:

- the number of affected rows on success
- an array of errors if the inserted values did not match the field types specified as the constants in the subclass definition
- false on database error

Parameters:

- *updates*

An associative array of updates to perform, where the key specified the column, and the value the new entry.

- *conditions*

A Condition object, or an array of Condition objects governing which rows in the table will be updated with new value(s).

*e.g.* Update username of user with userid 12 to `jimmy`:

    User::update(
        array('username' => 'jimmy'),
        new Condition('userid', 12)
    );


### insert

`insert()`

Instance method. Insert an object into its corresponding table. You first construct an instance, filling out its properties, then simply call `insert()`. Return values:

- the id of the inserted row on success
- an array of errors if insert values did not match the field types or restrictions of the table columns
- false on database error

*e.g.* Insert a favourite for Jimmy into the `favourites` table.

    $f = new Favourite;
    $f->userid = 12;
    $f->thingid = $thingid;
    $f->insert();


## Usage in a web application

For a simple web app, you might typically define your TinyModel subclasses in a single file, thereby specifying the tables you wish to communicate with.

The controller layer includes this file, and can then makes calls to the `fetch`, `update` and `insert` methods of your subclasses.

For a functioning example, see the file `demo.php`. (You will need to need to create the relevant database and tables.)
